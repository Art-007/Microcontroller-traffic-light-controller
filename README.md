# Microcontroller-traffic-light-controller
## This project involved the use of Mplab software, pickit 4, and Pic18f to implement the traffic controller. 
### *We designed a traffic light control system that will operate with two modes: Day-Mode and Night-Mode in a lCD screen. A light sensor is used to differentiate between these two modes. When the light is bright, the system is in DayMode and when in the dark, the system will run in Night-Mode.*
